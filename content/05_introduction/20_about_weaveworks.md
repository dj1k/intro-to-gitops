## Weaveworks and AWS

Weaveworks is an [APN Advanced Technology Partner](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Weaveworks&id=001E000001ImwwVIAR) and AWS Containers Competency Partner. Weaveworks makes it fast and simple for developers and DevOps teams to build and operate powerful containerized applications. We minimize the complexity of operating workloads in Kubernetes by providing automated continuous delivery pipelines, observability and monitoring.  One of the first members of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Weaveworks also contributes to several open source projects, including Weave Scope, Weave Cortex and Weave Flux.

Weaveworks stands the traditional infrastructure-centric model on its head. Instead of provisioning infrastructure and then fitting your applications to it, we start with your application and mold the necessary infrastructure around it. 

Our mission is to minimize complexities in operating workloads and provide a developer centric operating model for cloud native applications. 

Our goal is to drive cloud native transformation for your developers and portability, flexibility, choice and stability for your business.
