### Shop Sock

For our labs, we picked up the Sock Shop application. Sock Shop is a microservice sample application initially developed by [WeaveWorks](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo) for demoing and testing purposes. WeaveWorks made it open source so itâ€™s been used by many other organizations for learning purposes.

### Shop Sock Architecture

The architecture of the demo microserivces application was intentionally designed to provide as many microservices as possible. If you are considering your own design, we would recommend the iterative approach, whereby you only define new microservices when you see issues (performance/testing/coupling) developing in your application.

Furthermore, it is intentionally polyglot to exercise a number of different technologies. Again, we'd recommend that you only consider new technologies based upon a need.

As seen in the image above, the microservices are roughly defined by the function in an e-commerce site. Networks are specified, but due to technology limitations may not be implemented in some deployments.

All services communicate using REST over HTTP. This was chosen due to the simplicity of development and testing. Their API specifications are under development.
