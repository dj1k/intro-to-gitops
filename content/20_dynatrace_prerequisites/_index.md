# Dynatrace Setup

To complete the workshop, you first need a Dynatrace tenant to monitor AWS resources and completed the workshop exercises.  Please choose the link from one of the following options:

**Option 1: I need a Dynatrace tenant**

Navigate to [Sign up for a 15-day trial](/20_dynatrace_prerequisites/10_dynatrace_trial.html)

**Option 2: I already have a Dynatrace tenant**

You will need admin rights to configure configuration rules and install agents. Ensure you have authority within your organization to do this in your tenant.

If you are running the workshop on your own Dynatrace tenant, then navigate to: [Attach the IAM role to your workspace](/20_dynatrace_prerequisites/20_ec2instance.md.html) step.
